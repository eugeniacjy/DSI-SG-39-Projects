### Introduction:

Welcome to Eugenia's Github! This repository comprises of the projects completed as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive. Please find the project summaries below.

---

### Project 1: Climate Data Analysis (Pandas)

#### Project Summary:
As an analyst with Cooling Singapore, a multi-disciplinary research group who is working on understanding and developing solutions for urban heat issues, you are investigating the relationship between temperature change and household electricity use (a) over time, and (b) within the year. Give some recommendations on what could be done.

#### Skills Required:
- Basic statistics and probability
- Many Python programming concepts
- Programmatically interacting with files and directories
- Visualizations
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Working with Jupyter notebooks for development and reporting

### Project 2: Prediction of HDB Resale Prices (Regression)

#### Project Summary:
You are tasked with creating a regression model based on Singapore Housing Dataset to predict the price of a house at sale. The data set comprises 150,000 HDB resale transactions over 9 years, with over 70 columns of features relating to houses. Give some recommendations on pricing of resale flats based on your findings.

#### Skills Required:
- Refining models over time
- Use of train-test split, cross-validation, and data with unknown values for the target to simulate the modeling process
- The use of Kaggle as a place to practice data science

### Project 3: Web APIs and Natural Language Processing (Classification)

#### Project Summary:

You are a healthcare group that has developed a classification tool to identify users' affiliation with either Intermittent Fasting or Anorexia Nervosa, based on inputs gathered from two subreddit communities representing these groups. While both intermittent fasting and anorexia nervosa involve food restriction, the former is a popular health trend whereas the latter is an eating disorder.

Demo at: https://project-3-app.streamlit.app

#### Skills Required:
- Webscraping using PRAW library
- Use of NLTK library to identify trends in language
- Converting of text to numeric form for modeling through vectorization
- Building models for classification focused problems

### Project 4: Predicting the Spread of West Nile Virus ()

#### Project Summary:
You are tasked to effectively plan the deployment of pesticides in order to mitigate the spread of the West Nile Virus in Chicago City, through the use of data science methods. You will need to analyse the data given by the Department of Public Health to (a) produce a predictive model to guide spraying of pesticides, and (b) provide an assessment of the costs vs benefits of the cost and effectiveness of pesticide spraying.


#### Skills Required:
- Data cleaning and analysis across multiple large data sets
- Use of SMOTE to address class imbalance
- Building models for classification focused problems
- Building of pipelines for train-test split and hyperparameter tuning
